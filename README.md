<h1 align="center">ZumruduAnka WebShell v1.0</h1>

ZumruduAnka is an open source web shell/red teaming tool developed as a proof of concept using the GPT-4 model. 

This webshell is a proof of concept of how tools can be developed using artificial intelligence given the appropriate prompts. Only minor bug fixes have been made to make it work properly.

Features that exist at the moment:

- Command execution
- File operations; upload, edit, delete, search
- Obtaining information about the system
- View processes running in the background
- Ability to send mail

There is currently no directory switching and renaming feature. It is planned to be added in the future. 

**Notice: It is for educational purposes only, cannot be abused! The developer accepts no responsibility for any use other than for this purpose.**
